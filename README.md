Homework 2
Due: 2/29/20

About me page:
    Added a picture and biography

Contact:
    Removed the form
    Added 3 cards - two are currently functional (github and linkedin) and a third is a placeholder for now
        <!-- Will need to update the icon pictures eventually -->

Portfolio:
    Unsure how this will be utilized at the moment.
    Plan is to provide a screenshot of the project on the left, which may or may not link to something relevant
    Then will provide a project title and description
    <!-- Maybe include tags with relevant used skill per project -->

Style:
    Changed the background image and a bunch of colors around. Used a pallet I found online.
